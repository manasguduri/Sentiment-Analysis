*Developed an application that extracts the hashtags that are trending in twitter and identified the users who used the hashtags and created a graph visualizing these factors
*Used Girvan Newman cluster analysis algorithm to cluster the users based on the hashtags
*Collected tweets and used machine learning algorithms like SVM, naïve based and logistic regression to predict the sentiment
*Computed average testing accuracy for each model over k-fold of Cross validation and documented the accuracy comparison analysis
